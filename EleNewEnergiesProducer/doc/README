This module is a producer of ValueMaps that associate to each electron
in the GsfElectron collection, one float that is a new type of energy
associated to the electron. 
The core of the module is the plugin EleNewEnergiesProducer.cc whose
cfi.py file is elenewenergiesproducer_cfi.py

The plugin just create the new collection, loop over the gsfElectron
collection and calculate the new energy according to a separate class
that should called by the plugin. The implementation of the
calculation of the new energy should not be done in the plugin but in
a separate class in order to keep it more general and flexible.
The separate class can be added in the src directory or already
present in some other CMSSW package (add the required lines in the
BuildFile.xml).
