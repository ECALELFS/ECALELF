ECALELF ntuples are produced by the ZNtupleDumper class. Follow the
link to see the branches that are implemented. 

The idea is to keep very small ntuples (almost essential for the needs
of standard calibration, energy scale and smearings evaluation).  
One branch with the Z invariant mass for each energy
version is provided also, in order to speed at maximum the fitting
procedure avoiding the recalculation of the invariant mass.

Nonetheless, other additional ntuples can be produced in order to save
additional informations for particular studies. This ntuples are
complementary to the default ones (the name of the basic tree is
"selected").
The additional ntuples should be used adding them to the "selected"
ntuples as friend trees.

The designed structure should garantie flexibility (additional studies
can be done with additional ntuples) and fastness (one can use the
ntuples that really needs).

Ntuples are produced both for centrally produced datasets and private
ECALELF rerecoes. Additional ntuples are not produced by default but
only for the cases when they are required.
