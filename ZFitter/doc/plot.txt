* \page plotNtuple How to make plots using ECALELF ntuples

If you are interested only in using the fit for validations you can
skip this paragraphs and go directly to "RERECO VALIDATION instructions"

The .dat config file keeping the list of ntuples can be modified according to the needs adding or commenting unuseful ntuples or friend trees.
It's then important to have a simple way to merge the trees in order to be able to manipulate, scan and plot variables from the ntuples.
The ZFitter/script/GenRootChains.sh has been designed for this.

running the command:
\verbatim
./script/GenRootChains.sh -f data/validation/myConfigFile.dat 
\endverbatim
in the folder tmp/myConfigFile/ the s_chain.root and d_chain.root are created
for MC and data respectively.  The .root files have the TChains already
defined, merging the files with the same treeName in the config file and
adding the friends properly. 

To work with ntuples you can do (see practical example below):
\verbatim
root -l tmp/myConfigFile/d_chain.root tmp/myConfigFile/s_chain.root
data    -> Draw("*");
signalA -> Draw("*");
\endverbatim

# Data/MC plots
A standard function for data/MC plots have been prepared and is available in
python/plot.py. An example of how to use this library is in
macro/standardDataMC.py

In the following you can find an example of production of data/MC plots with a config file with 
Moriond17 new regression
\verbatim
./script/GenRootChains.sh -f data/validation/Moriond17_newRegr_v2.dat
python macro/standardDataMC.py  invMass invMass_ECAL_ele -d tmp/Moriond17_newRegr_v2/d_chain.root -s tmp/Moriond17_newRegr_v2/s2_chain.root
\endverbatim
