#======================================== Working with ntuples: how to
#                                         play by hand with ntuples

If you are interested only in using the fit for validations you can
skip this paragraphs and go directly to "RERECO VALIDATION instructions"

The .dat config file keeping the list of ntuples can be modified according to the needs adding or commenting unuseful ntuples or friend trees.
It's then important to have a simple way to merge the trees in order to be able to manipulate, scan and plot variables from the ntuples.
The ZFitter/script/GenRootChain.sh has been designed for this.

running the command:
./script/GenRootChain.sh -f data/validation/myConfigFile.dat 
in the tmp/ the s_chain.root, d_chain.root load.C are created for MC and data respectively.
The .root files have the TChains already defined, merging the files with the same treeName in the config file and adding the friends properly. 
Due to a bug in ROOT in order to properly load the files the load.C script is created.

To work with ntuples you can do (see pratical example below):
root -l tmp/d_chain.root tmp/s_chain.root tmp/load.C
data    -> Draw("*");
signalA -> Draw("*");

NB: Please check in the load.C file the correct assignment of the tree pointer to the correct file.

#============================== Data/MC plots
A standard function for data/MC plots have been prepared and is available in macro/PlotDataMC.C

In the following you can find an example of production of data/MC plots with a config file with 
22Jan rereco data, run dependent MC (three samples with different generators: s1, s2, s3)
./script/GenRootChain.sh -f data/validation/22Jan2012-runDepMCAll_v2.dat
root -l -b -q tmp/d_chain.root tmp/s1_chain.root tmp/s2_chain.root tmp/load.C macro/standardDataMC.C

*****************
The load.C script is commented below:
{
  gROOT->ProcessLine(".L macro/PlotDataMC.C+"); // -> functions for data/MC plots
  gROOT->ProcessLine(".L src/setTDRStyle.C");
  gROOT->ProcessLine(".L macro/addChainWithFriends.C+"); // -> functions to work around ROOT bugs in friend treatment

  setTDRStyle1();

  TChain *data   = (TChain *) _file0->Get("selected");  // -> pointers to samples
  TChain *signalA = (TChain *) _file1->Get("selected"); // -> pointers to samples
  TChain *signalB = (TChain *) _file2->Get("selected"); // -> pointers to samples
  TChain *signalC = (TChain *) _file3->Get("selected"); // -> pointers to samples

  ReassociateFriends(_file0, data);    // -> functions to correct associate the friends to their main trees
  ReassociateFriends(_file1, signalA); // -> functions to correct associate the friends to their main trees
  ReassociateFriends(_file2, signalB); // -> functions to correct associate the friends to their main trees
  ReassociateFriends(_file3, signalC); // -> functions to correct associate the friends to their main trees

   TDirectory *curDir = new TDirectory("curDir","");
   curDir->cd();

  TString outputPath="tmp/";

// look at standardDataMC.C for some examples  
}
*****************
The standardDataMC.C example:
{
  std::vector<TString> mcLabel_vec;  // create a vector of labels for the MC samples
  mcLabel_vec.push_back("Madgraph");
  mcLabel_vec.push_back("Powheg");
  mcLabel_vec.push_back("Sherpa");

  //MakeChainVector(signalA,signalB,signalC) 
  
  c = PlotDataMCs(data, // pointer to data chain
                  MakeChainVector(signalA,signalB,signalC), // creates a vector of chains for MCs
                  "etaEle",  // variable to be plotted
                  "(100,-2.5,2.5)", // binning of x axis
                  "eleID_loose-trigger-noPF-Et_25", // stream based selection with ECALELF convention -> a specific class takes care in parsing the string and provide the selections cuts
                  "", // additional selection string in standard ROOT syntax,
                  "Data", // label for data in Legend
                   mcLabel_vec, // vector of strings for MC labels in legend
                   "#eta", // x axis title
                   "", 
                   false, // do plot in log scale
                   true // reweight MC for PU
                   ); // use r9weight
   c->SaveAs(outputPath+"etaEle-r9reweighted-Et_25.eps");
   c->SaveAs(outputPath+"etaEle-r9reweighted-Et_25.C");
  delete c;
}
