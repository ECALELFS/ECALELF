/**
 * \page runDivideB How to produce runRanges .dat files 

The idea is to produce a file with the run ranges with 100k Zee events
(to have enough statistics in the EE), but taking into account also
that some run ranges should not be between to TSs or two era (RUN A
and B).


The run ranges:
 - put in the data/runRanges/runRangeLimits.dat the runNumber that should start a new run range (TSs for example)
 - run the command
\code ./bin/ZFitter.exe -f file.dat --runDivide \endcode

The ZFitter.exe options are:
\code
  --runDivide                                  execute the run division
  --nEvents_runDivide arg (=100000)            Minimum number of events in a 
                                               run range
\endcode
