/**
 * \page runDivideB How to produce runRanges .dat files 

The idea is to produce a file with the run ranges with ~100k Zee events
(to have enough statistics in the EE), but taking into account also
that some run ranges should not be between to TSs or two era (RUN A
and B).


The run ranges:
 - put in the data/runRanges/runRangeLimits.dat the runNumber that should start a new run range (TSs for example)
 - run the command
\code ./bin/ZFitter.exe -f file.dat --runDivide \endcode

This way you will be using the default commonCut and default eleID.
The commonCut and eleID options can be used to pre-select the number of events in the run range.

The ZFitter.exe options are:
\code
  --runDivide                                  execute the run division
  --nEvents_runDivide arg (=100000)            Minimum number of events in a 
                                               run range
\endcode
