/**
* \page ZFitterConfigFiles Config files syntax and generation

There are three important directories where the proper .dat files should be put:
- data/validation/ <BR>
   For the validation of rerecoes, the .dat files has to be put in a subdirectory of data/validation:
   ./data/validation/rereco/rerecoGroupName/
   where rerecoGroupName is a name that you assign to a group of rerecoes that you want to test
   for example: you can use ./data/validation/rereco/Cal_Dic2013/
                or ./data/validation/rereco/ungrouped/
   this way the fit results will be put under the subdirectory
   rerecoGroupName and you will be able to move or remove it when the
   set of validations has finished. <BR>
   The logic of the validation .dat files is reported below in a
   dedicated section.


  For standard validations you can use the data/regions/validation.dat
  that is set in the scripts as the default one.

- data/regions/
  the fits are done in categories, the conditions that the electrons
  have to fulfil are defined in .dat files in this directory.
  In each .dat file, a set of categories are defined, one category for
  each line: see ElectronCategory_class for more information about the syntax



- data/runRanges/
  contains files that define a set of run ranges in order to perform
  the fits for the stability plots. The default one to be used is
  data/runRanges/monitoring.dat

  The syntax is the following:
\verbatim
  #runMin-runMax nEvents        timeStampMin-timeStampMax
  190645-190781	28734   	1333819264-1333983242
  190782-191042	24007		1334023525-1334188134
\endverbatim
  The second and third column are optional.
  
  For more information on how to produce automatically the runRanges .dat files see:  \ref runDivide


\section validationConfig Validation config files
This config file contains the list of files to run on, the files
containing the PU histograms for the PU reweighting and all the other
files needed.
The main idea in the ECALELF framework is to have a minimum set of
variables in very small trees (the tree name is "selected"), while
additional branches can be produced and added if needed as tree
friends. The advantage is the possibility to produce ntuples for a
larger set of studies with small specific trees for each of them. 


The file is structured in 3 columns: tag, treeName and filePath as in the follows:
\verbatim
# commented lines
# tag	treeName	file
s1	selected	root://eoscms//eos/..../file.root
s2	selected	root://eoscms//eos/..../file.root
d1	selected	root://eoscms//eos/..../file.root
d	pileupHist	/afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSALCA/ALCA_ECALCALIB/ECALELF/puFiles/190456-204567-13Julv2_lastPrompt.69400.observed.root
s	pileupHist	/afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSALCA/ALCA_ECALCALIB/ECALELF/puFiles/nPU-Summer12_DD3.observed.root

\endverbatim

	The first column (tag) indicates if this file is signal MC (s), background MC (b), or data (d). 

        The single samples are indicated by a number (s1, s2, etc., d1, d2, etc.)

	The second column (treeName) is the name of the tree in the file

	The third column (filePath) is the full path of the file
	files with the same tag and the same treeName are put in the
        same chain
	files with the same tag but different treeName are added as
	friends 


\subsection pileupHist	How to get the pileup histogram
When running the alcareco production for the MC, an additional file called PUDumper.root is produced for each job.
It contains the 


\subsection pileup	Hot to produce ntuples with pileup weights
In the config file the pileupHist must be indicated. When running the ZFitter.exe it will automatically calculate the weights and create the additional ntuples in the \code tmp/ \endcode directory.
To just produce the ntuples:
\code ./bin/ZFitter.exe -f data/validation/22Jan2012-stdMCAll.dat --savePUTreeWeight \endcode

It's sufficient to copy them from the tmp/ directory to another directory and to add them to the config file. 
Usually the pileupHist and pileup tree are put in the following directory:
\code /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSALCA/ALCA_ECALCALIB/ECALELF/puFiles/ \endcode




\section runDivide How to produce runRanges .dat files 

The idea is to produce a file with the run ranges with 100k Zee events
(to have enough statistics in the EE), but taking into account also
that some run ranges should not be between to TSs or two era (RUN A
and B).


The run ranges:
 - put in the data/runRanges/runRangeLimits.dat the runNumber that should start a new run range (TSs for example)
 - run the command
\code ./bin/ZFitter.exe -f file.dat --runDivide \endcode

The ZFitter.exe options are:
\code
  --runDivide                                  execute the run division
  --nEvents_runDivide arg (=100000)            Minimum number of events in a 
                                               run range
\endcode
