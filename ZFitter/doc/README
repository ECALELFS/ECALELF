* \page page4 How to work with ECALELF ntuples

Go to the Calibration/ZFitter directory and compile it: 
\code make\endcode

Calibration/ZFitter will be your working directory now on.

Two methods are used in order to evaluate the energy scale and
resolution:
 - fitMethod: consists in fitting the Z lineshape with a parametric
model
   This method gives an estimate of the Z peak and width separately
for data and MC. On the other hand the energy scale and energy
resolution are estimated for electrons belonging to the same
di-electron categories. With this method the energy scale and
resolution are measured for di-electron categories.

 - smearingMethod: consists in using the Z lineshape from MC after the
scaling and smearing of the single electron energy.
   The energy scale and smearing is applied to the single electron
energy before calculating the invariant mass, so they are directly
the single electron energy scale and smearings.

The methods are implemented in separate classes, there is only one
executable (./bin/ZFitter.exe) that with command line options can run the fitMethod or the
smearingMethod.

The inputs to the ZFitter program are given in the form of:
 - configuration files (.dat)
 - command line options

The configuration files are described in: \ref ZFitterConfigFiles

The ntuple structure and logic is explained in \ref NtupleStructure

#============================================================
The files containing the histograms for the PU reweight are
indicated with pileupHist as treeName and they are treated in a
different way. There must be only one pileupHist for d and one for s,
then the program calculates the weights for the MC, produces a
temporary file with just one tree containing the weights (pileupTree)
and it is added as friend to the chain of MC. You can also provide
directly the "temporary" root file indicating
s	pileupTree	file.root



Package content:
 - BW_CB_pdf_class
	Class providing a RooPdf correspoding to the convolution of a
	Breit-Wigner and Crystal Ball
 - Cruijff_pdf_class
	Class providing a RooPdf corresponding to a Cruijff function
        (Gaussian with exponential tails)
 - ElectronCategory_class
	Parser class for electron categorization providing TCuts for
	RooDataset 
 - ZFit_class 
	Class for fitting the Z lineshape from any RooAbsData 
 - ZFitter
	General program for Z fit (monitoring, calibration validation)

Input:
While the classes are almost generic and flexible, the ZFitter program
is thought to be used starting from ECALELF ntuples (ZNtuples).

 - data ntuples must contain:
	- a tree "selected"
 - mc ntuples must contain:
	- a tree "selected"
 - config file: see next section
 - run range config file:
	file containing a list of run ranges: every region will be
	checked in every run range in this file
 - category config file:
	file containing a list of regions (categories) for electrons
	it will be combined with the run range config file (if provided)
 - option:
	- global pt cut
	- selection
	- energy used for the invariant mass calculation (invMass_var)
	- (not implemented) bin/unbin/mixed: performe binned/unbinned fit or a mix
	  version (unbinned for < mixedSwitchValue events, binned otherwise) 
	- (not implemented) mixed switch value: 200 by default 
	- 

If no external PU reweight is provided and no tree containing the PU
reweight for the MC, the program reads the files, add all the data PU
histograms, add all the MC PU histograms, calculates the PU
reweight, produce a tree with the per event weight for the MC. 
Then add the tree with the PU weights to the MC chain as a friend
tree.
