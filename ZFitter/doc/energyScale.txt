\page scaleSmearings Energy scale and smearings application

\section Use of energy scale and smearings in external frameworks
The energy scale and smearings derived with ECALELF framework are provided as .dat files.

The module to read and get the energy scale and smearings for the different electron categories is EnergyScaleCorrection_class

Constructor of the class: 
  EnergyScaleCorrection_class(TString correctionFileName, 
			      TString smearingFileName=""); 

the method to get the correction is 
  float ScaleCorrection(int runNumber, bool isEBEle, double R9Ele, double etaSCEle, 
			double EtEle,
			int nPV, float nPVmean=0);
