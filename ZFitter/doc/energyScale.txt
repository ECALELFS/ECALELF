\section Workflow to derive energy scales and smearings

Multistep procedure:
 - first create a config file with the list of ntuples
 - 


\section Use of energy scale and smearings in external frameworks
The energy scale and smearings derived with ECALELF framework are provided as .dat files.

The module to read and get the energy scale and smearings for the different electron categories is EnergyScaleCorrection_class

\verbatim
Constructor of the class: 
  EnergyScaleCorrection_class(TString correctionFileName, 
			      TString smearingFileName=""); 

the method to get the correction is 
  float ScaleCorrection(int runNumber, bool isEBEle, double R9Ele, double etaSCEle, 
			double EtEle,
			int nPV, float nPVmean=0);

\endverbatim
