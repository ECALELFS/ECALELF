\section Workflow to derive energy scales and smearings

Multistep procedure:
 - first create a config file with the list of ntuples
 - 


\section Use of energy scale and smearings in external frameworks
The energy scale and smearings derived with ECALELF framework are provided as .dat files.

The module to read and get the energy scale and smearings for the different electron categories is EnergyScaleCorrection_class

\verbatim
Constructor of the class: 
  EnergyScaleCorrection_class(TString correctionFileName, 
			      TString smearingFileName=""); 

the method to get the correction is 
  float ScaleCorrection(int runNumber, bool isEBEle, double R9Ele, double etaSCEle, 
			double EtEle,
			int nPV, float nPVmean=0);

\endverbatim


\subsection scaleSmearing Energy scale and smearing corrections 
Energy scale and smearings can be applied to the already existing ntuples.
One can have different sets of energy scales and smearings, depending
on 
 - the particular energy used for the invariant mass, 
 - the particular algorithm
 - the number of steps in iterative procedure 

For more details see the section dedicated to the energy scale and
smearing derivation.

Each set of energy scale and smearing corrections is defined by a
"type" name. You can add all the wanted set of scale and smearing
correction files to the same validation config file, but only the one
specified by the --corrEleType and --smearEleType options are used.
The name of the trees of the corrections are defined as follows:
 <basename>_<type>, where <basename> is scaleEle for energy scale
 corrections and smearEle for energy smearings.
This way you don't need to modify your validation config file each
time you want to run with a different set of corrections, you just
need to pass the appropriate type name at the command line.
