<h1><a class="anchor" name="NtupleStructure">Ntuple content and logic of use</a></h1>ECALELF ntuples are produced by the <a class="el" href="da/df9/classZNtupleDumper.html">ZNtupleDumper</a> class. Follow the link to see the branches that are implemented.<p>
The idea is to keep very small ntuples (almost essential for the needs of standard calibration, energy scale and smearings evaluation). One branch with the Z invariant mass for each energy version is provided also, in order to speed at maximum the fitting procedure avoiding the recalculation of the invariant mass.<p>
Nonetheless, other additional ntuples can be produced in order to save additional informations for particular studies. This ntuples are complementary to the default ones (the name of the basic tree is "selected"). The additional ntuples should be used adding them to the "selected" ntuples as friend trees.<p>
The designed structure should garantie flexibility (additional studies can be done with additional ntuples) and fastness (one can use the ntuples that really needs).<p>
Ntuples are produced both for centrally produced datasets and private ECALELF rerecoes. Additional ntuples are not produced by default but only for the cases when they are required. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on 23 Feb 2014 for ECALELF by&nbsp;
