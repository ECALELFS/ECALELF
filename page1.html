## ECALELF (Ecal CALibration with ELectrons Framework)  
## study and calibration with Zee and E/p
## Code instructions and explanations
############################################################

All the code needed to the ECAL studies and calibration with Zee is
available in this package.

This and other README file in the package are the only documentation
provided. 

The code in this package takes the name of ECALELF 
(Ecal CALibration with ELectrons Framework) 
In each subfolder you will find a README in the doc/ directory
containing all the relevant informations about the module and it's
use.

Informations for the implementation or re-implementation can be
obtained looking the the various header files that will be completed
with exaustive documentation (in the future)

If you have doxygen, you can run the command
doxygen fulldoc 
from the calibration/ directory and you can navigate instructions and code with
firefox doc/doxygen/fulldoc/html/index.html

============================== Introduction

The general calibration workflow is:
 1a) start from RAW-RECO
 1.1a) apply a ZSkim or WSkim selection to reduce the size of the dataset
 2a) produce the ALCARAW:
    in this format most of the collections are
    dropped and only the electrons, the uncalibrated rec hits
    and few other collections like the beamspot, the conversions, the
    rhoFastJet are kept
 3a) Apply whatever ECAL tags (ADCtoGeV, IC, LC, Alpha) needed for test
    or calibration and produce a new file in ALCARECO format.
    The new file has a reduced collection of calibrated rechit of the
    reco electrons, new SC collections produced with the new calibrated
    recHits, the old reco electrons with a new SC associated
    CAVEAT: all the electron variables are still the old RECO one,
    only the reference to the new SC has been updated. This will not be
    fixed, since it's a wanted feature that ensures that the selected
    events are not changed and permit to check effectively the impact
    of the calibration on the same events.
 4) calculate new electron energies with the EleNewEnergiesProducer
    that creates ValueMaps that associate a float (the new energy) to
    the electrons
 5) define if the electron pass some selections running the
    EleSelectionProducer that creates valueMaps of floats with the
    following meaning:
    for cut-based selections 1=pass, 0=fail
    for MVA selections the float is the output of the MVA
 6.0) for MC, produce an association map between reco electron and gen
      electron (data-MC match)
 6.1) produce a patElectron collection where the electronID floats and
    the new energies are imported by the patElectron and accessible by
    electron.electronID("selectionName")
    electron.userFloat("energyName") 
    the gen electron identified by the data-MC matching step are
    embended in the patElectron and accessible by:
    electron.genLepton().eta()
    electron.genLepton().energy()
 7) Filter the events requiring that the electron has passed at least
    one selection
 8) dump the event content to a flat tree with one entry for Zee
    candidate (the variables are array of two elements with one electron
    per element)
 9) Run the analysis tools (Z fitter, smearing, etc.)

 

In case the purpose is just to run on a particular dataset without any
recalibration step, the 1-3a) steps can be replaced by

 1b) Start from RECO or AOD
 2b) Produce directly the ALCARECO, dropping all the unuseful
     collections and reducing the recHit maps to the one related to
     the electrons
 3b) nothing 

## For further implementations
#Step 5) could be done after step 1) since electronID and isolations
#are not updated by the sandbox recalibration and then could be
#performed just once.

Instructions for ALCARAW and/or ALCARECO production are in 
calibration/ALCARAW_RECO/doc/README

Instructions for ntuple production is in 
calibration/ZNtupledDumper/doc/README



Good luck!
