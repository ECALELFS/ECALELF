/**
\page NAMECONVENTIONS_ Name conventions in ECALELF

For book-keeping it's important to respect a naming convention.

\subsection JSONNAME_ Short name of the json file
The full name of a json file is too long to be retained.
Ntuples are produced using a json file, so to keep track of the used json file, the ntuples are stored under a directory having the short name of the json file.

The convention is the following:
\verbatim  {runMin}-{runMax}_{rerecoName|Prompt}_v{versionID} \endverbatim
  - runMin is the first run of the json
  - runMax is the last run of the json
  - rerecoName is the official name of the reprocessing or use "Prompt" if prompt reco
  - every json file is produced with a version number _v1  or _v2, etc. Use the same

For example, for the json file: 
\verbatim 
 /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions12/8TeV/Reprocessing/Cert_190456-208686_8TeV_22Jan2013ReReco_Collisions12_JSON.txt
\endverbatim
the jsonName should be: 190456-208686_22Jan_v1
