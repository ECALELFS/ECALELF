# ECALELF (Ecal CALibration with ELectrons Framework)  
## study and calibration with Zee and E/p
############################################################


All the code needed to the ECAL studies and calibration with Zee is
available in this package.

The documentation of this packaged is provided in these pages extracted with doxygen from the source code and several txt files contained in the package itself.

The code in this package takes the name of ECALELF 
(Ecal CALibration with ELectrons Framework) 

Informations for the implementation or re-implementation can be
obtained looking the the various header files that will be completed
with exaustive documentation (in the future)

If you have doxygen, you can run the command
\code doxygen fulldoc  \endcode
from the Calibration/ directory and you can navigate instructions and code locally with
\verbatim firefox doc/doxygen/fulldoc/html/index.html \endverbatim


### The general calibration workflow is:
\image html doc/ecalelf_schema.png
\image latex doc/ecalelf_schema.eps

 1. start from AOD/RECO or AOD/RECO+RAW
 2. apply a ZSkim or a ZSCSkim or a WSkim selection to reduce the size of the dataset 
 3. produce the ALCARAW from AOD/RECO+RAW:
    in this format most of the collections are
    dropped and only the electrons, the uncalibrated rec hits
    and few other collections like the beamspot, the conversions, the
    rhoFastJet are kept

 4. Apply whatever ECAL tags (ADCtoGeV, IC, LC, Alpha) needed for test
    or calibration and produce a new file in ALCARECO format.
    The new file has a reduced collection of calibrated rechit of the
    reco electrons, new SC collections produced with the new calibrated
    recHits, the old reco electrons with a new SC associated
    CAVEAT: all the electron variables are still the old RECO one,
    only the reference to the new SC has been updated. This will not be
    fixed, since it's a wanted feature that ensures that the selected
    events are not changed and permit to check effectively the impact
    of the calibration on the same events.

 5. calculate new electron energies with the EleNewEnergiesProducer
    that creates ValueMaps that associate a float (the new energy) to
    the electrons

 6. define if the electron pass some selections running the
    EleSelectionProducer that creates valueMaps of floats with the
    following meaning:
    for cut-based selections 1=pass, 0=fail
    for MVA selections the float is the output of the MVA

 7. for MC, produce an association map between reco electron and gen
      electron (data-MC match)

 8. produce a patElectron collection where the electronID floats and
    the new energies are imported by the patElectron and accessible by
    electron.electronID("selectionName")
    electron.userFloat("energyName") 
    the gen electron identified by the data-MC matching step are
    embended in the patElectron and accessible by:
    electron.genLepton().eta()
    electron.genLepton().energy()

 9. Filter the events requiring that the electron has passed at least
    one selection

 10. dump the event content to a flat tree with one entry for Zee
    candidate (the variables are array of two elements with one electron
    per element)

 11. Run the analysis tools (Z fitter, smearing, etc.)

 

In case the purpose is just to run on a particular dataset without any
recalibration step, the 1-3a) steps can be replaced by

 1. Start from RECO or AOD
 2. Produce directly the ALCARECO, dropping all the unuseful
     collections and reducing the recHit maps to the one related to
     the electrons
 3. nothing
