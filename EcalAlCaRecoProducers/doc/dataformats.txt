 The calibration in 2012 with electrons (single and double electron
samples) will be performed using the alcareco data format that
contains only relevant collections for the ECAL calibration with
electrons. 

If you have not followed the instructions in the Calibration/README
file please do it.


ALCARECO and ALCARAW private production logic.

\subsection dataformats Data formats
 - EcalUncalElectron (ALCARAW): Special data format for rereco purpose
	- in CMSSW from the 7_X_X release
	- no official ALCARAW have been produced so far
        - Actually produced privately starting from RAW-RECO Z and W
          skims 
 - EcalCalElectron (ALCARECO): Reduced format for RECO data
	- can be produced starting from RECO or AOD standard formats
	- this is the stardard format after rereco of data using
          ECALELF (starting from ALCARAW)  
	- Now in CMSSW and produced centrally with a ZW skim applied
          (WP90 selection) 
          -> the ALCARECO format has been updated, the CMSSW version 
             is deprecated
	- can be produced also privately starting from RAW-RECO Z and
          W skims 

\subsection bookKeeping Files for book keeping: used to create, submit and book-keep the
     production 
 - alcaraw_datasets.dat
 - alcareco_datasets.dat
 - alcarereco_datasets.dat
 - ntuple_datasets.dat


\subsection bookKeepingFormat Book-keeping files content and syntax
 - For each line one crab task is created.
 - Their contents are not exactly the same.
 - Lines can be commented with a # at the beginning of the line.
 - Columns are separated by TAB.

\section alcarawDatasetsFormat alcaraw_datasets.dat
\verbatim
# RUNRANGE     DATASETPATH                                                 DATASETNAME	                           STORE_PATH_BASE   USER_REMOTE_DIR_BASE                  VALIDITY   PERIOD
190456-193621  /DoubleElectron/Run2012A-ZElectron-13Jul2012-v1/RAW-RECO    DoubleElectron-ZSkim-RUN2012A-13Jul-v1  caf               group/alca_ecalcalib/ecalelf/alcaraw  VALID      RUN2012ABC,Cal_Nov2012
\endverbatim

For each line a crab task is created
 - RUNRANGE: only events in the indicated run range are processed
 - DATASETPATH: This is the real DBS dataset path (full name)
 - DATASETNAME: This is a short name which will be used now on to refer
             to the specified DATASET. The DATASETNAME is used in the
             construction of the output folders!
 - STORE_PATH_BASE: indicates the storage element where to store the
		 output
		 it can be: caf or T2_IT_Rome (if other are needed,
                 please contact cms-ecalelf-devel)
 - USER_REMOTE_DIR: this is the directory on the Storage Element under
                 the store/ folder
		 Usually files are stored on the T2_CH_CERN EOS system
		 in the ALCA group folders:
		 group/alca_ecalcalib/ecalelf/alcaraw (private production)
		 It can be "database" that indicates that the dataset
                 is published and available in DBS (e.g. official ALCARECO) 
 - VALIDITY (only meaningful for ALCARAW): 
	  for each line in this file the corresponding ALCARAW 
	  files are present on EOS. There can be the necessity to exclude
 	  from the RERECO process some ALCARAW datasets 
	  because obsolete or superseeded by others. For example a new
	  alcaraw can be produced on the same run range using a newer central
	  rereco, in this way the RECO quantities in the alcaraw have better
	  conditions, like eleID and iso variables. 
	  Possible values are:
	   - VALID (good for rereco)
	   - INVALID (not used for rereco)
	In this way it's not necessary to remove the files from EOS
	and in the alcaraw_datasets.dat there is always the list of
	folders and files present on EOS.
 - PERIOD: in case of rereco, you want to run on more than one line (more
	run ranges). 
	To make life easier, a comma separated list of
	"periods" can be associated to the line. In this way, when
	launching a rereco, we can specify just the period and all the
	lines associated to it will be rerecoed (if valid!)  


\section alcarecoDatasetsFormat alcareco_datasets.dat

In this file are reported all the datasets for which the ALCARECO is
produced with the same sintax as alcaraw_datasets.dat .
They can be produced centrally in ALCARECO format (prompt or
rerecoes) or produced by the user from AOD or RECO or MC (AODSIM).
For the official alcareco, it has to be indicated using the word "database" 
instead of group/alca_ecalcalib/ecalelf/alcareco and ZAlcaSkim in the dataset
name to keep memory of the origin of the ALCARECO (if you want to
produce the same privately for example). 
e.g. DoubleElectron-ZAlcaSkim-RUN2012D-22Jan-v1 (centrally produced)
instead of DoubleElectron-ZSkim-RUN2012D-22Jan-v1 (private production)

\section alcarerecoDatasetsFormat alcarereco_datasets.dat
This file is filled automatically by the rereco scripts. 

One example line is:
\verbatim
# RUNRANGE	DATASETPATH	DATASETNAME	STORE_PATH_BASE	USER_REMOTE_DIR	ALCARAW_REMOTE_DIR	TAG
190456-193621   /DoubleElectron/Run2012A-ZElectron-13Jul2012-v1/RAW-RECO        DoubleElectron-ZSkim-RUN2012A-13Jul-v1  caf.cern.ch     group/alca_ecalcalib/ecalelf/alcarereco      group/alca_ecalcalib/ecalelf/alcaraw    Cal_Nov2012_ICEle_v1
\endverbatim

In this file there are two additional fields:

 - ALCARAW_REMOTE_DIR: this is the output directory where of the ALCARAW
                     production step, if for any reason the standard
		     ALCARAW is produced elsewhere, this should be
		     reported here by the rereco script (you should
		     provide this information with the script option)
 - TAG: this is the "rereco name". This will be explained better in the
      rereco section


#### OUTPUT DIRECTORIES:
 The remote directory in the storage element is set as follows:
\verbatim
USER_REMOTE_DIR=$USER_REMOTE_DIR_BASE/${ENERGY}/${DATASETNAME}/${DATASETNAME}-${RUNRANGE:-allRange}
\endverbatim
where ENERGY is 7TeV for 2011 datasets and 8TeV for 2012 datasets
